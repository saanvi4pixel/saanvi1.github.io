        Hey, I'm Saanvi and the WORLD is full of mistakes.<br>
        Well, I love making mistakes. I like to be corrected again and again.
        TRUST ME,there is nothing wrong about making mistakes. So , before we start
        look at the <em>heading</em>.It says COMMON mistakes, mistakes that everyone makes
        . Even me.So, Lets take this is as an interactive program.
    </p>
    <h3>Mistake no.1<br>
        Incomplete Comparisons</h3>
        <p>This one drives me up a wall when I see it in the wild.
             Can you see what's wrong with this sentence?<br>
        
        Our car model is faster, better, stronger.<br>
        
        Faster, better, stronger ... than what? 
        What are you comparing your car to? A horse? 
        A competitor's car? An older model?<br>
        
        When you're asserting that something should be compared to 
        something else, make sure you always clarify what that something 
        else is. Otherwise, it's impossible for your readers to discern what
         the comparison actually means. </p>
         <h3>Mistake no.2:Possessive Nouns</h3>
                <p>Most possessive nouns will have an apostrophe -- but 
                    where you put that apostrophe can be confusing. Here
                    's an example of possessive nouns used incorrectly:
                <ul>
                <li>All of the lizard's tails grew back.</li>
            </ul>
               In this sentence, "all" implies there's more than one lizard, 
               but the location of the apostrophe suggests there really is
                just one.</p>
                
                Here are a few general rules to follow:
                <ol>
                <li>If the noun is plural, add the apostrophe after the s. 
                    For example: the dogs' bones.</li>
                <li>If the noun is singular and ends in s, you should also put
                 the apostrophe after the s. For example: the dress' blue 
                 color.</li>
                <li>On the other hand, if the noun is singular and doesn't
                 end in an s, you'll add the apostrophe before the s.
                  For example: the lizard's tail.</li>
                <h5>Simple, right? If you want a deeper dive into the rules

                 <h3>mistake no.3:Affect vs. Effect</h3>
                        <p>This one is another one of my pet peeves. 
                        Most people confuse them when they're talking about 
                        something changing another thing.</p>
                        
                        <h5> eg.That movie effected me greatly.</h5>
                        
                        <p>Effect, with an "e," isn't used as a verb the way "affect" is, 
                            so the sentence above is incorrect. When you're talking about the 
                            change itself -- the noun -- you'll use "effect."</p>
                        
                        <h5>That movie had a great effect on me.</h5>
                        
                        <p>When you're talking about the act of changing -- the verb --
                             you'll use "affect."<br>
                        
                        That movie affected me greatly.</p>
                        
                        <h3> Mistake no.4:Me vs. I</h3> 
                        <p>Most people understand the difference between the two of these, until it comes time for them to use one in a sentence.<br>
                        
                        When you get done with that lab report, can you send it to Bill and I?<br>
                        
                        The sentence above is actually wrong, as proper as it sounds.<br>
                        
                        Try taking Bill out of that sentence -- it sounds weird, 
                        right? You would never ask someone to send something to "I" 
                        when he or she is done. The reason it sounds weird is because 
                        "I" is the object of that sentence -- and "I" should not be
                         used in objects. In that situation, you'd use "me."<br>
                        
                        When you get done with that lab report, can you send it to Bill and me?
                        
                        Much better.</p>
                        
                        <h3>mistake no.5: To vs. Too</h3>
                        <p>We've all accidentally left the second "o" off of "too" when texting 
                            in a hurry. But in case the mistake goes beyond that, let's review
                             some usage rules.<br>
                        
                        "To" is typically used before a noun or verb, and describes
                         a destination, recipient, or action. Take these examples:<br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>My friend drove me to my doctor's appointment. (Destination)</li>
                        
                        <li>I sent the files to my boss. (Recipient)</li>
                        
                        <li>I'm going to get a cup of coffee. (Action)</li>
                    </ol>
                        
                        <p>"Too," on the other hand, is a word that's 
                            used as an alternative to "also" or "as well."
                             It's also used to describe an adjective in
                              extremes. Have a look:<br>
                        
                        My colleague, Sophia Bernazzani, writes for the HubSpot marketing blog, too.<br>
                        
                        She, too, is vegan.<br>
                        
                        We both think it's too cold outside.</p>
                        <p>I hope that everything is now clear to you people.<br>
                        <h2>I KNOW IT IS!!</h2></p>
