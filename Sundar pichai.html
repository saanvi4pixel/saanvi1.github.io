           <h2 class="basin">EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h2>
    <p class="list">
                Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. His mother 
                Lakshmi was a stenographer and his father, Regunatha Pichai was an
                electrical engineer at GEC, the British conglomerate. His father
                also had a manufacturing plant that produced electrical 
                components. Pichai grew up in a two-room apartment in 
                Ashok Nagar, Chennai.<br>

            Pichai completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, 
            a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok 
            Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani
            school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
            He earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology 
            Kharagpur in metallurgical engineering and is a distinguished
            alumnus from that institution.[18] He holds an M.S. 
            from Stanford University in material sciences and engineering,
            and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of
            Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar
            and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.

    <h2 class="basin">CAREER</h2>
        <p class="list">Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied 
            Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey and Company. 
            Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and 
            innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, 
            including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely
            responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development
            of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.On November
            19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS; the Chromebook
                was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the
                public in 2012.[26] On May 20, 2010, he announced the 
                open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and 
                introduced the new video format, WebM.<br>

                On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of 
                Google products that he oversees. Android was formerly
                managed by Andy Rubin. He was a director of Jive Software 
                from April 2011 to July 30, 2013. Pichai was selected
                to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015 after 
                previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page.
                On October 24, 2015 he stepped into the new position at the 
                completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding 
                company for the Google company family.<br>
            
                Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's 
                CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya
                 Nadella.<br>
                
                    In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a 
                    Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing 
                    the company's diversity policies and arguing that
                    "distribution of preferences and abilities of men 
                    and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... 
                    these differences may explain why we don't see equal 
                    representation of women in tech and leadership".
                    While noting that the manifesto raised a number
                    of issues that are open to debate, Pichai said in a
                    memo to Google employees that "to suggest a group of
                    our colleagues have traits that make them less 
                    biologically suited to that work is offensive and not
                    OK".
                    
                    In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet
                    Conference in China, where he stated that a lot of work 
                    Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many 
                    small and medium-sized businesses in China who take advantage
                    of Google to get their products to many other countries
                    outside of China.</p>
